Amazon EC2- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.

HORIZONTAL SCALING -Horizontal Scaling is the act of changing the number of nodes in a computing system without changing the size of any individual node.

VERTICAL SCALING- Vertical Scaling is increasing the size and computing power of a single instance or node without increasing the number of nodes or instances.
INSTANCE TYPES-    General Purpose Instances(A1,M5,T3/T3a)
                   Compute Optimized Instances.(C5/C5N,C6/C6g)
                   Memory Optimized Instances. (R5,R5a,R5n,R6g/R6gd,X1/X1e)
                   Accelerated Computing Instances.(P3,P2,Inf1,G3,G4,F1)
                   Storage Optimized Instances.(D2,H1,I3/I3en)

ELASTIC IP- An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address associated with your AWS account in a specific Region.
Unlike the auto-assigned public IP address, an Elastic IP address is preserved after you stop and start your instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC)


SECURITY GROUPS- A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance.

EBS- AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) is Amazon's block-level storage solution used with the EC2 cloud service to store persistent data.
This means that the data is kept on the AWS EBS servers even when the EC2 instances are shut down.
AmazonEBS provides six volume types: 
Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 and io1), General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2), Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1).
